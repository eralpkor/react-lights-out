# Lights Out Game

## Build with React.js

### Enjoy!



#### LightsOut is based on a deceptively simple concept. Clicking on a cell toggles that cell and each of its immediate neighbors. The goal is to turn out all the lights, ideally with the minimum number of clicks.

The easiest way to solve LightsOut puzzles is to use a method called Chase The Lights. Starting with the second row, click on every cell that has a light on in the row above it. This will turn off all the lights in that row. Continue with each successive row until the only remaining lights are in the final row.
